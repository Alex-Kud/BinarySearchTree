# BinarySearchTree
The task of the internship in Open Solution
It is necessary to develop a structure representing a binary tree. At the same time, each vertex of the tree contains any natural number. It is necessary to write an algorithm that implements the generation of this tree and provides the output of this tree to a file. Next, write algorithms that traverse this tree in width and depth (two types) and determine whether the number at the vertex is prime. Compare the time of traversal and vertex search when traversing in depth and width. It is also necessary to output the found primes.
